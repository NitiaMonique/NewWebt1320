        <h2>Black panther</h2>
        <p>
            The block buster Marvel movie, Black Panther, directed by Ryan Coogler was so much more    
            than a movie. It was the first time an African American played a superhero and highlighted 
            the point of view from African Americans eyes. There were no stereotypes of black people while 
            also highlighting black culture. The movie was inspirational and showcased a world where black
            people prospered in an unknown world called Wakanda. Away from the evils and oppression in other
            parts of the world. But the brother of the king had a son named Killmonger. He chanllenged
            King T' Challa for the throne as he was upset that the people of this hidden world stayed 
            in the shadows and watched as people who looked lke them were treated as less than human.</p>
