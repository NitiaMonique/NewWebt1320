        <p>
            The block buster Marvel movie, Black Panther, directed by Ryan Coogler was so much more    
            than a movie. It was the first time an African American played a superhero and highlighted 
            the point of view from African Americans eyes. There were no stereotypes of black people while 
            also highlighting black culture. The movie was inspirational and showcased a world where black
            people prospered in an unknown world called Wakanda. Away from the evils and oppression in other
            parts of the world. But the brother of the king had a son named Killmonger. He chanllenged
            King T' Challa for the throne as he was upset that the people of this hidden world stayed 
            in the shadows and watched as people who looked lke them were treated as less than human.</p>

            <P>
            The movie was a hit! Until the tragic and  unexpected death of Chadwick Boseman, the man who played
            Black Panther. August 28, 2020 Chadwick passed from colon cancer. He let no one know of his condition.
            He gave so many black children a all around the world a superhero who looked like them. He has 
            received many accolades during his time as an actor, including two Screen Actors Guild awards, a Golden
            Globe award, a Critic's Choice Movie award, a Primetime Emmy award and a an Academy award. He has left
            his mark on the world with his talent and will never be forgotten.
