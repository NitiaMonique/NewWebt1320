            <h5>What Is Dust?</h5>
            <p>Dust was an elementary particle. It had different names in the different worlds of the 
                multiverse: Dust or Rusakov Particles in Lyra's world, Shadows, Shadow-particles or dark
                matter in Will's world, and sraf in the mulefa world. Angels were beings entirely composed
                of Dust. The Authority was the first angel to condense this way, and claimed to those that
                followed that he created them. Spectres consumed the consciousness of a living person, 
                destroying their Dust and the capacity to produce it.</p>

            <h5>Sequels</h5>
            <p>In addition to the trilogy there are also two short novels: Lyra's Oxford and Once Upon a 
                Time in the North. Lyra's Oxford is a sequel to The Amber Spyglass, and tells the story of 
                a witch who seeks revenge for her son's death in the war against the Authority. She draws 
                Lyra into a trap, but birds mysteriously rescue her and Pan and she makes the acquaintance
                of an alchemist who was formerly the witch's lover. Once Upon a Time in the North is a prequel
                to His Dark Materials and focuses on the 24-year-old Texan aeronaut Lee Scoresby. After winning 
                his hot-air balloon, Scoresby heads to the North, landing on the Arctic island Novy Odense, 
                where he finds himself pulled into a dangerous conflict between the oil-tycoon Larsen Manganese, 
                the corrupt mayoral candidate Ivan Poliakov, and his longtime enemy from the Dakota Country, 
                Pierre McConville. The story tells of Lee and Iorek's first meeting and of how they overcame 
                these enemies.</p>
